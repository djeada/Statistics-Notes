#### Expected Value and Standard Error
- **Expected Value**: The average value we would expect from random draws from a population.
  - For one random draw, the expected value is the population mean, μ.
  - For a sample of size \( n \), the expected value of the sample mean, \( E(\bar{x}_n) \), is also μ.

- **Standard Error (SE)**: Measures the variability of a sample statistic (e.g., sample mean) from its expected value.
  - SE for the sample mean: 
    \[
    SE(\bar{x}_n) = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
    \]
    - SE decreases as the sample size increases, which means larger samples provide more accurate estimates of the population mean.
  
#### Standard Error for the Sum and Percentages
- **Sum of Draws (Sₙ)**: If you are interested in the sum rather than the average:
  \[
  E(Sₙ) = n \mu, \quad SE(Sₙ) = \sqrt{n} \sigma
  \]
  - The variability of the sum increases with the square root of the sample size.
  
- **Percentages**: The expected value and SE for percentages in a sample can be calculated using similar principles.
  - Expected percentage: \( E(\text{percentage of 1s}) = \mu \times 100\% \)
  - SE for percentages:
    \[
    SE(\text{percentage of 1s}) = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \times 100\%
    \]

#### Law of Large Numbers
- **Definition**: As the sample size increases, the sample mean (x̄) tends to get closer to the population mean (μ).
  - The standard error (SE) decreases as sample size increases, indicating more reliable estimates.
  - Applies to averages and percentages but not sums, as the SE for sums increases with sample size.
