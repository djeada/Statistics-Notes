## Bayesian vs Frequentist Statistics

## Introduction
   - Bayesian and frequentist statistics are two main approaches to statistical inference.
   - Both aim to make conclusions about the underlying population based on sample data.

## Frequentist Statistics

A. Key concepts
   - Parameters are fixed but unknown quantities.
   - Confidence intervals: range of values where a parameter is likely to fall, with a certain level of confidence.
   - Null hypothesis testing: comparing observed data with what's expected under a null hypothesis.
   
B. Advantages
   - Simpler and easier to understand for non-specialists.
   - Well-established methods for large sample sizes.
   
C. Limitations
   - Can lead to counterintuitive results, especially for small sample sizes.
   - Does not incorporate prior knowledge.

## Bayesian Statistics

A. Key concepts
   - Parameters are treated as random variables with probability distributions.
   - Prior: existing knowledge about a parameter's distribution before observing data.
   - Likelihood: how probable the observed data is under different parameter values.
   - Posterior: updated probability distribution of a parameter after incorporating observed data.

B. Advantages
   - Allows for incorporation of prior knowledge.
   - Can produce more intuitive results, particularly for small sample sizes.
   - Provides a probabilistic interpretation of parameter estimates.
   - Rigorous framework for making assumptions, even when dealing with small datasets.

C. Limitations
   - More computationally demanding.
   - Results can be sensitive to the choice of prior.

## Bayesian vs Frequentist Convergence
   - With a large number of samples, Bayesian and frequentist methods converge.
   - When using uninformed priors (i.e., no prior knowledge), Bayesian and frequentist results are the same.

## Coin Flip Example
   - Flipping a coin 5 times and getting all heads: Bayesian methods allow incorporating prior knowledge about the prevalence of fair and unfair coins.
   - Flipping a coin 1000 times and getting 1000 heads: Bayesian methods can update the prior assumption and conclude the coin is likely unfair.

## Incorporating Prior Knowledge
   - Even without specific knowledge about a topic, some outcomes can be deemed implausible based on general understanding.
   - Example: Snake lifespan model. A 1000-year lifespan is less plausible than a 10-year lifespan, even without detailed knowledge about snakes.

## Choosing an Approach
   - Consider the problem's context and the availability of prior knowledge.
   - Assess the sample size and computational resources available.
   - Understand the goals of the analysis and the desired interpretation of results.

## Conclusion
   - Both Bayesian and frequentist statistics have strengths and limitations.
   - The choice between the two depends on the specific problem, available data, and goals of the analysis.
   - Bayesian methods offer a flexible and rigorous approach to incorporate prior knowledge and assumptions, making them particularly useful for small datasets and when prior information is available.
