### Prerequisite

- The **series.md** file covers essential concepts that serve as a foundation for understanding time series.
- The **difference_equations.md** document explains the necessary difference equations required for analyzing time series data.

### Intro

- The **time_series.md** introduces the concept of time series as the foundation for further analysis.
- The **seasonality_and_trends.md** discusses patterns like seasonality and trends that affect the stationarity of a time series.
- The **autocorrelation_function.md** explains the relationship between observations at different times in a series.
- The **autocovariance_function.md** delves deeper into the covariances over time, complementing the autocorrelation function.

### Core with Focus on Practice

- The **modeling_time_series.md** provides an introduction to various models used in time series analysis.
- The **autoregressive_models.md** introduces AR models, which are a foundational approach in time series modeling.
- The **moving_average_models.md** discusses MA models, which complement AR models in time series analysis.

### More Mathematical Background

- The **stationarity.md** discusses stationarity, a key concept that ensures the properties of a time series remain constant over time.
- The **random_walk.md** introduces random walks as an example of non-stationary processes in time series.
- The **backward_shift_operator.md** explores tools like the backward shift operator, which are useful for modeling time series data.
- The **invertibility.md** explains conditions like invertibility that are necessary for ensuring the consistency of time series models.
- The **yule_walker_equations.md** dives into the equations used for estimating the parameters of AR models.

### Ultimate

- The **forecasting.md** applies all the discussed concepts to the goal of forecasting future values in a time series.
