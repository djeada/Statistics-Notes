## Seasonal Decomposition 

Seasonal decomposition of time series is a technique that deconstructs a time series into its constituent components: trend, seasonal, and residual. The Seasonal-Trend decomposition procedure based on LOESS (STL) is a robust method for this decomposition. This method is particularly useful for analyzing time series data with complex seasonal and trend patterns.

### Example

To illustrate STL decomposition, we'll generate a synthetic time series dataset that exhibits clear seasonal patterns, trends, and some random noise. We'll then apply STL decomposition to this data and visualize the components.

This plot shows the original synthetic time series data, combining seasonal, trend, and noise components.

The original data exhibits an upward trend with clear seasonal fluctuations and some random noise. This visualization helps in understanding the overall structure and patterns in the time series.

By performing STL decomposition, we can separately analyze the trend, seasonal, and residual components, providing insights into the underlying structure of the time series data. This technique is particularly useful for identifying patterns and making more accurate forecasts.

**Seasonal Component**:
- **Plot Description**: This plot shows the seasonal fluctuations in the data, which repeat annually.
- **Interpretation**: The seasonal component captures the repeating yearly pattern, demonstrating the synthetic seasonal effect added to the data. It shows how the data values fluctuate within each year.

**Trend Component**:
- **Plot Description**: This plot represents the long-term progression of the data over the entire period.
- **Interpretation**: The trend component shows a clear upward trajectory, indicating a consistent increase in the data over time. This is consistent with the linear trend added to the synthetic data.

**Residual Component**:
- **Plot Description**: This plot displays the residuals, which are the remaining variations in the data after removing the trend and seasonal components.
- **Interpretation**: The residual component reflects random noise. It should ideally display no discernible pattern, indicating that the trend and seasonality have been effectively removed from the data. The residuals appear to be randomly distributed around zero, confirming that the decomposition has captured the main patterns in the data.
