| **Model**           | **Components**                          | **Use Case**                                                                                     | **Key Assumptions**                                                                                                     | **Strengths**                                                      | **Limitations**                                                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AR (Autoregressive)** | Past values of the series ($Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2}, \dots$) | Captures relationships between past values of the series.                                        | Stationarity (constant mean/variance over time).                                                                        | Simple to interpret, works well for stationary data.             | Struggles with non-stationary data or irregular patterns.         |
| **MA (Moving Average)** | Past forecast errors ($\epsilon_{t-1}, \epsilon_{t-2}, \dots$) | Models influence of random shocks (errors) on the series.                                       | Stationarity, white noise assumptions for residuals.                                                                     | Captures short-term dependencies caused by noise.                | Requires identifying significant error lags.                     |
| **ARMA (AR + MA)**     | Combines AR and MA components ($p, q$) | Models both past values and past forecast errors.                                                | Stationarity, linear relationships in data.                                                                             | Balances past values and shocks.                                  | Struggles with trends or seasonality.                            |
| **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)** | AR + MA + differencing ($p, d, q$)                     | Handles non-stationary data by differencing.                                                    | Differencing converts the data to stationary.                                                                            | Works for a wide range of stationary and non-stationary series.  | Choosing $p, d, q$ can be challenging.                       |
| **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)** | ARIMA + seasonal terms ($P, D, Q, m$)             | Models seasonal patterns in addition to trends and noise.                                       | Seasonality is stable and periodic (fixed frequency).                                                                    | Ideal for seasonal data with trends.                              | Computationally intensive, requires specifying seasonal terms.   |
| **SES (Simple Exponential Smoothing)** | Weighted average of past observations                   | Forecasts data without trends or seasonality (level only).                                       | Data has no trend or seasonality; relies on exponential weighting.                                                      | Easy to use, good for flat, stationary series.                    | Poor for data with trends or seasonality.                        |
| **Holt's Linear**     | SES + trend component                     | Models level and trend for forecasting.                                                         | Additive linear trend (no seasonality).                                                                                  | Good for data with trends but no seasonality.                     | Fails if seasonality is present.                                 |
| **Holt-Winters**      | SES + trend + seasonality components     | Models level, trend, and seasonality.                                                           | Additive or multiplicative seasonality; periodic patterns are consistent over time.                                      | Captures complex patterns in data.                                | Requires stable seasonal structure.                              |
| **ETS (Error-Trend-Seasonality)** | Exponential smoothing framework                       | Flexible model for level, trend, and seasonality.                                               | Error, trend, and seasonality are modeled explicitly.                                                                     | Automatically selects the best smoothing model.                   | Less interpretable than ARIMA-type models.                       |
| **VAR (Vector Autoregression)** | Multivariate time series (relationships between multiple series). | Models relationships between two or more time series.                                            | All series must be stationary; interdependence is linear.                                                                | Handles interdependent series; works well for causal analysis.    | Complex; all series must be stationary and interrelated.         |
| **ARCH (Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)** | Variance of errors depends on past variances.            | Models volatility clustering in financial/economic data.                                         | Errors exhibit changing variance (heteroskedasticity).                                                                   | Great for analyzing volatility in returns or prices.              | Assumes specific forms of variance dynamics.                     |
| **GARCH (Generalized ARCH)** | Extends ARCH with lagged variance terms.            | Captures long-term and short-term volatility in data.                                           | Errors have heteroskedasticity and correlations in variance.                                                              | Flexible, captures complex volatility patterns.                   | Requires careful parameter tuning.                               |
| **TBATS (Exponential Smoothing State Space Model)** | Exponential smoothing + trend + seasonality + Box-Cox.  | Complex seasonal patterns (e.g., multiple seasonalities).                                         | Handles irregular and multiple seasonalities.                                                                            | Flexible for advanced forecasting scenarios.                      | Computationally intensive.                                       |
| **Prophet (Facebook)** | Trend + seasonality + holidays.        | Forecasts with irregular data and explicit handling of external events.                         | Assumes linear or logistic growth; holidays/events are known and well-defined.                                           | User-friendly, handles missing data and holidays.                 | Less precise for short-term, high-frequency data.                |
