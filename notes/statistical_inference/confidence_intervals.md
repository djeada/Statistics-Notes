## Confidence Intervals

A confidence interval is a range of values, derived from a data sample, that is used to estimate an unknown population parameter. It provides an interval estimate that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence. The confidence level is a measure of the certainty that the interval contains the true parameter.

### Definition

A confidence interval is defined as:

$$
(\text{Point Estimate} - \text{Margin of Error}, \text{Point Estimate} + \text{Margin of Error})
$$

Where:

* Point Estimate: The best single estimate of the population parameter based on the sample data.
* Margin of Error: A measure of the uncertainty in the point estimate.

### Confidence Level

The confidence level represents the degree of certainty that the true population parameter lies within the confidence interval. Common confidence levels are 90%, 95%, and 99%. A higher confidence level indicates greater certainty that the interval contains the true parameter, but the interval will be wider.

### Example: Estimating the Mean Weight of Carry-on Bags

In a previous example, we calculated the mean weight of a sample of carry-on bags as 3.2 with a standard error of 0.053. To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the mean weight of all carry-on bags, we would use the following formula:

$$
\text{Confidence Interval} = \text{Sample Mean} \pm \text{Standard Error} * \text{Critical Value}
$$

For a 95% confidence level, the critical value (from the standard normal distribution) is 1.96.

$$
\text{Confidence Interval} = 3.2 \pm 0.053 * 1.96 = (3.09612, 3.30388)
$$

Thus, we can say with 95% confidence that the mean weight of all carry-on bags lies within the interval (3.09612, 3.30388) kg.

It is important to note that the confidence interval does not mean that there is a 95% chance that the true population mean lies within the interval. Instead, it means that if we were to repeat the sampling process many times, 95% of the confidence intervals calculated from those samples would contain the true population mean.
