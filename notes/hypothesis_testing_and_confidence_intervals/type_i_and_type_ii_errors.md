## Type I and Type II Errors

In hypothesis testing, there are two types of errors that can occur: Type I errors and Type II errors.

### Type I Error (False Positive)

A Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is true, but it is incorrectly rejected. This is also known as a false positive. The probability of making a Type I error is denoted by the significance level, α.

**Example:**

Suppose a pharmaceutical company is testing a new drug for treating a disease. The null hypothesis states that the drug is not effective. If the test results incorrectly indicate that the drug is effective (i.e., the null hypothesis is rejected when it is true), a Type I error has occurred. In this case, the company might waste resources on a drug that is not actually effective.

### Type II Error (False Negative)

A Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, but it is not rejected. This is also known as a false negative. The probability of making a Type II error is denoted by β.

**Example:**

Continuing with the pharmaceutical company example, suppose the new drug is actually effective, but the test results fail to show this effectiveness (i.e., the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is false). In this case, a Type II error has occurred. The company might miss out on a potentially effective treatment for the disease.

### Balancing Type I and Type II Errors

In practice, it is important to balance the risks of making Type I and Type II errors. Reducing the significance level (α) reduces the risk of making a Type I error but increases the risk of making a Type II error. Conversely, reducing the probability of a Type II error (β) increases the risk of making a Type I error.

The power of a test, denoted as (1 - β), is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. Ideally, researchers aim for high power and low Type I error rates, but these goals are often in conflict. It is crucial to consider the specific context of the study and the consequences of each type of error when deciding on an appropriate balance between Type I and Type II error rates.
