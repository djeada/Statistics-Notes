## Measures of Central Tendency

<details>

<summary>What is the mean?</summary><br>

The **mean** is the sum of all data values divided by the number of data points. It is the most commonly used measure of central tendency and represents the average of a dataset. The formula for the mean is:

$$\text{Mean} = \frac{\sum X_i}{n}$$

where $X_i$ are the individual data points, and $n$ is the number of data points.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What are some limitations of using the mean?</summary><br>

The mean can be heavily influenced by outliers, or extremely high or low values, which can distort the representation of the central tendency. Additionally, the mean is not always appropriate for skewed data distributions, where the median may be a better measure.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the median?</summary><br>

The **median** is the middle value of a dataset when the data is ordered from smallest to largest. If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values. Unlike the mean, the median is less affected by outliers and skewed data.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do you calculate the mode?</summary><br>

The **mode** is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have no mode, one mode (unimodal), or multiple modes (bimodal, multimodal) if there are several values that occur with the same highest frequency.

</details>

## Measures of Dispersion

<details>

<summary>What is range?</summary><br>

The **range** is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. It provides a simple measure of data dispersion, though it can be heavily influenced by outliers. The formula for the range is:

$$\text{Range} = \text{Max} - \text{Min}$$

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you calculate variance?</summary><br>
**Variance** measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It quantifies how spread out the data points are. The formula for variance is:

$$\text{Variance} (\sigma^2) = \frac{\sum (X_i - \mu)^2}{n}$$

where $X_i$ are the data points, $\mu$ is the mean, and $n$ is the number of data points.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is standard deviation?</summary><br>
**Standard deviation** is the square root of the variance. It is a widely used measure of dispersion that provides insight into the average distance of data points from the mean. A smaller standard deviation indicates that data points are clustered close to the mean, while a larger standard deviation suggests greater spread.

The formula is:

$$\text{Standard Deviation} (\sigma) = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (X_i - \mu)^2}{n}}$$

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why is standard deviation preferred over variance?</summary><br>

Standard deviation is often preferred over variance because it is in the same units as the original data, making it easier to interpret. Variance, on the other hand, is in squared units, which can make the measure less intuitive.

</details>

## Data Distribution

<details>

<summary>What is a frequency distribution?</summary><br>

A **frequency distribution** is a summary of how often different values or categories occur within a dataset. It can be visualized using tables or charts such as histograms, showing the frequency of each data point or category.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is a histogram?</summary><br>

A **histogram** is a type of bar chart that represents the distribution of numerical data. The data is divided into intervals, or bins, and the height of each bar represents the frequency of data points within that bin. Histograms are useful for identifying the shape of data distributions.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is skewness in a distribution?</summary><br>
**Skewness** refers to the asymmetry in the distribution of data. A distribution is said to be:
- **Positively skewed** (right-skewed) if the tail on the right side is longer, indicating that there are more high outliers.
- **Negatively skewed** (left-skewed) if the tail on the left side is longer, indicating that there are more low outliers.

If the distribution is symmetrical, skewness is zero.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is kurtosis?</summary><br>
**Kurtosis** measures the "tailedness" of a distribution, or the tendency of data points to cluster in the tails or near the mean. Distributions with high kurtosis have more data points in the tails (leptokurtic), while those with low kurtosis have fewer points in the tails (platykurtic). A normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3 (mesokurtic).

## Percentiles and Quartiles

<details>

<summary>What is a percentile?</summary><br>

A **percentile** is a measure that indicates the value below which a given percentage of data points fall. For example, the 90th percentile is the value below which 90% of the data points lie. Percentiles are useful for comparing individual data points to the overall dataset.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you calculate quartiles?</summary><br>
**Quartiles** divide a dataset into four equal parts, each containing 25% of the data. The **first quartile (Q1)** is the 25th percentile, the **second quartile (Q2)** is the median or 50th percentile, and the **third quartile (Q3)** is the 75th percentile. Quartiles help in understanding the spread and distribution of data.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the interquartile range (IQR)?</summary><br>

The **interquartile range (IQR)** is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). It measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data and is a useful measure of dispersion that is not affected by outliers. The formula is:

$$\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1$$

</details>

## Z-scores

<details>

<summary>What is a Z-score?</summary><br>

A **Z-score** represents how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean of a dataset. It is used to standardize data, allowing for comparisons across different datasets or variables with different units. The formula is:

$$Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$$

where $X$ is the data point, $\mu$ is the mean, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why are Z-scores useful?</summary><br>

Z-scores are useful for standardizing data, which allows for comparison between data points from different distributions. For example, you can use Z-scores to compare exam scores across different subjects, even if the exams have different means and standard deviations.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What does a positive or negative Z-score indicate?</summary><br>

A **positive Z-score** indicates that the data point is above the mean, while a **negative Z-score** indicates that the data point is below the mean. A Z-score of 0 means that the data point is exactly at the mean.

</details>

## Outliers

<details>

<summary>What is an outlier?</summary><br>

An **outlier** is a data point that differs significantly from the rest of the data. Outliers can be caused by measurement errors, variability in the data, or rare occurrences. They can have a significant impact on statistical measures such as the mean and variance.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do you identify outliers?</summary><br>
Outliers can be identified using various methods:
- **Z-score method**: Data points with Z-scores greater than 3 or less than -3 are often considered outliers.
- **IQR method**: Data points that are below $Q1 - 1.5 \times \text{IQR}$ or above $Q3 + 1.5 \times \text{IQR}$ are considered outliers.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the impact

 of outliers on data analysis?</summary><br>

Outliers can skew the results of data analysis by inflating or deflating measures like the mean and standard deviation. It is important to identify and address outliers, as they may represent errors or rare but significant data points.

</details>

## Graphical Summaries

<details>

<summary>What is a bar plot?</summary><br>

A **bar plot** is a graphical representation of categorical data where the length of each bar corresponds to the frequency or count of each category. Bar plots are useful for comparing different categories or groups within a dataset.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is a box plot?</summary><br>

A **box plot** (or box-and-whisker plot) is a graphical summary that shows the distribution of a dataset based on five summary statistics: minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum. The "whiskers" extend to the smallest and largest values, and any points outside this range may be considered outliers.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the purpose of using a histogram?</summary><br>

A **histogram** helps visualize the distribution of numerical data by showing the frequency of data points within predefined intervals or bins. It provides insight into the shape, center, and spread of the data, as well as whether the data is skewed or symmetric.
