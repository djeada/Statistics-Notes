# Variance Example

A random variable comes out 0 half the time and 100 half the time.

What is the expected value?

$$\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)0 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)100 = 50$$

What is the variance?

$$\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)0 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(10,000) - 2500 = 2500$$

What is the standard deviation?

$$\sqrt{2500} = 50$$
